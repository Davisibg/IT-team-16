My name is ibinabo Collins 
	DevOps combines development and IT operations to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and deliver high-quality software faster.
	My favorite DevOps tool is AWS because it's amazing how you can create servers from different time zones and run multiple systems at the same time.
	The Git command i learned is Git Branch: which shows the current git branch you are in.
